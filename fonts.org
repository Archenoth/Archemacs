The font I typically like to use in my configuration is M+ 1m, which can be downloaded and installed from [[https://osdn.net/projects/mplus-fonts/releases/62344][here]]!

* =.emacs= snippet
After installing the above font, the following can be placed in your [[file:~/.emacs][.emacs]] to make it the default font:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
               '(font . "-unknown-M+ 1m-light-normal-normal-*-*-98-*-*-d-0-iso10646-1"))
#+END_SRC

* .emacs-less version (Linux only)
If you don't want to make any changes to your [[~/.emacs][.emacs]], you can just tangle this file, though *be warned that this will overwrite your =.Xresources= file* if you have made any modifications to it.

If you are okay with this, the key combo to install it is =C-c C-v t=. (But if not, you can copy it in there too!)
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle (when (eq system-type 'gnu/linux) "~/.Xresources") :padline no
Xft.antialias:  1
Xft.dpi:    96
Xft.hinting:    1
Xft.hintstyle:  hintsfull
Xft.lcdfilter:  lcddefault
Xft.rgba:   rgb
Emacs.font: M+ 1m-13
#+END_SRC

After you have this set up, in order to apply it, you either need to restart your X server, or run the following code block and restart Emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
#+END_SRC
