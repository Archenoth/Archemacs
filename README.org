#+TITLE:Archenoth's Emacs configuration

This is the Git repo for my Emacs configuration...

The way it is constructed, the file is supposed to be a standalone
configuration separate from =.emacs=, and simply loaded in.

That way, any private configuration or system-specific configuration
can take place without making any changes to the core configuration
in this repo.

So, if you cloned this repo directly into =.emacs.d=, you can simply
include it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle ~/.emacs.new :padline no
  (load "~/.emacs.d/dotemacs/dotemacs.el")
#+END_SRC

(You can use =C-c C-v t= in while visiting this file in =org-mode= to
export that code into =~/.emacs.new= if that's all you really need.)
