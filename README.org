#+TITLE:Archenoth's Emacs configuration

Org-mode Emacs configuration is what all the cool kids are doing these
days... So here is the Git repo for [[file:./Archenoth-config.org][my Emacs configuration...]]

* About
The way it is constructed, the file is supposed to be a standalone
configuration separate from =.emacs=, and simply loaded in.

That way, any private configuration or system-specific configuration
can take place without making any changes to the core configuration
in this repo.

So, if you cloned this repo directly into =.emacs.d= (Which is highly
recommended), you can simply include it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle ~/.emacs :padline no
  (require 'ob-tangle)
  (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/dotemacs/Archenoth-config.org")
#+END_SRC

(You can use =C-c C-v t= while visiting this file in =org-mode= to
export that code into =~/.emacs= if that's all you really need, though
be warned that this will overwrite your existing =.emacs=)

* Installation in a nutshell
1. =cd= to =~/.emacs.d=
2. Run =git clone https://github.com/Archenoth/dotemacs.git=
3. Open this file in =org-mode=. (=emacs dotemacs/README.org=)
4. Tangle with =C-c C-v t= (Or if you have stuff in your =.emacs=,
   copy the above lines into it instead.).
5. Restart Emacs.
