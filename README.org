[[file:./Archenoth-config.org][Org-mode Emacs configuration]] is great! Surprisingly fast, easy to
organize, and it breaks down the way I've solved problems into little
bite-sized chunks that others can use.

* About
The way it is constructed, the file is supposed to be a standalone
configuration separate from =.emacs=, and simply loaded in.

That way, any private configuration or system-specific configuration
can take place without making any changes to the core configuration
in this repo.

So, if you cloned this repo directly into =.emacs.d= (Which is highly
recommended), you can simply include it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle ~/.emacs :padline no
  (require 'ob-tangle)
  (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/dotemacs/Archenoth-config.org")
#+END_SRC

(You can use =C-c C-v t= while visiting this file in =org-mode= to
export that code into =~/.emacs= if that's all you really need, though
be warned that this will overwrite your existing =.emacs=)

* Installation in a nutshell
1. =cd= to =~/.emacs.d=
2. Run =git clone https://github.com/Archenoth/dotemacs.git=
3. Open this file in =org-mode=. (=emacs dotemacs/README.org=)
4. Tangle with =C-c C-v t= (Or if you have stuff in your =.emacs=,
   copy the above lines into it instead.).
5. Restart Emacs.

* Conventions and Keybindings
I try to keep some conventions between modes in my configuration; The
following are keybindings that will generally do something similar in
all applicable modes:

| Key     | Action                          |
|---------+---------------------------------|
| s-<f3>  | Jump to definition              |
| <f5>    | Compile project / Run all files |
| C-c C-c | Run current block               |
| C-c C-k | Run file                        |

As for keybindings for global modes:

| Key   | Action                         |
|-------+--------------------------------|
| s-f   | Helm find file in project      |
| s-S-f | Helm find file in all projects |
| <f11> | Toggle Fullscreen              |
| s-S   | Multiple cursors next line     |
| M-s-S | Multiple cursors selection     |
| C-s-S | Multiple cursors mark all      |
| s-/   | Avy jump word beginnings     |
| s-?   | Avy jump all characters      |

I tend to like using the Super key because not many things in Emacs
are bound to it.
